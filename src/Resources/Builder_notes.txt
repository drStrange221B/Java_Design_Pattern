Concepts
1) Handles complex constructors
2) Large number of Parameters
3) object immutability
4) solves the problem as to which constructor to use if there are multiple constructor
5) Telescoping Constructor - having multiple variation of constructor. Builder pattern helps solve
   this problem by using the object instead the parameter.
6) Builder pattern use the STATIC INNER CLASSS.





                                                Contrast

            Builder                                                         Prototype
1) Handles complex constructors                     | 1) Implemented around a clone method
2) No interface required                            | 2) Avoids calling complex constructors
3) Can be implemented with separate class           | 3) Difficult to implement in legacy code
4) works with legacy code

Concepts
1) Handles complex constructors
2) Large number of Parameters
3) object immutability
4) solves the problem as to which constructor to use if there are multiple constructor
5) Telescoping Constructor - having multiple variation of constructor. Builder pattern helps solve
   this problem by using the object instead the parameter.
6) Builder pattern use the STATIC INNER CLASSS.
